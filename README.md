# Machine-Learning
R code: endocrine profiling with outcome variable = female puberty status 

In this project I establish optimal hyperparameters for the 'xgboost' machine learning algorithms.
The model was subsequently applied to the Bergen Growth Study 2 [vekststudien.no] female dataset:
outcome variable = puberty stage  &  dependent variables = anabolic/developmental hormone profile

Feel free to copy/paste code and adopt to your own use-case:)
